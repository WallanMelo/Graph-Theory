## Graph Theory
This repository contains materials developed for the **Graph Theory** course.  

The discipline focuses on the study of graphs as mathematical structures used to model relationships between objects, exploring both theoretical foundations and algorithmic applications.

Topics covered include:
- Representation of directed and undirected graphs  
- Paths and connectivity  
- Planarity  
- Graph coloring  
- Infinite graphs  
- Intractable problems  
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Shortest path algorithms  
- Spanning trees  
- Topological sorting  


Course taught by **Professor [Dr. Petrônio Cândido](https://github.com/petroniocandido)**.

### Objective 
This repository contains exercises, assignments, and projects developed for the **Graph Theory** course. The goal is to apply theoretical concepts of graph theory through practical implementations using Python, covering topics such as graph representations, traversals, weighted graphs, and real-world applications.
